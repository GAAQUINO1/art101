		<h1>Lab 6: Arrays and Objects</h1>
		<p>Working with your partner, expirement with basic
			Javascript data types and variables</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>The document.write worked in this lab first try,
			but the importing the java code into the page wasnt working.
			<br>
			The problem was that the path was getting mixed into the privous labs's java code.<br>
			The fix was simple, just set the path to this lab's java manually.
		</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p> The output works as intended and the page displays it properly.<br></p>
<h2>Script Output</h2>
